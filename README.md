# Stock-Price-Prediction
The project demonstrates a systematic approach to analyzing and forecasting stock prices, leveraging machine learning methods for accurate predictions.


The project conducts a comprehensive analysis of stock price data using machine learning techniques. It scales the data, splits it into training and testing sets, and prepares it for time series forecasting. Subsequently, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is built using the Keras library, which includes GRU and LSTM layers for sequence modeling. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data, with performance metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared score calculated. Checkpointing and learning rate reduction techniques are employed to optimize the model training process. Finally, the model is used to predict stock prices on the testing and full datasets, and the results are visualized and exported for further analysis. The code demonstrates a systematic approach to analyzing and forecasting stock prices, leveraging machine learning methods for accurate predictions.
